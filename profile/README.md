SimBricks is an open-source, modular simulation framework enabling full end-to-end evaluation of modern heterogeneous systems by combining battle-tested simulators for different system components like machines (e.g. QEMU, gem5, Simics), hardware components (e.g. Verilator, Tofino, FEMU SSD), and networks (e.g. ns-3, OMNeT++). SimBricks is fast, scalable, accurate and deterministically connects and synchronizes simulators while being able to run unmodified full system stacks, including applications, operating systems such as Linux, and hardware RTL.

The SimBricks core implementation is in our [main repository](https://github.com/simbricks/simbricks). To get started using SimBricks, we recommend our [examples repository](https://github.com/simbricks/simbricks-examples) containing a few concrete case-studies for how to use SimBricks.
